# Google App Engine Infrastructure Setup

This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up the Google App Engine (GAE) infrastructure using Terraform and deploying the application using a CI/CD pipeline.

## Terraform Configuration

### Files Overview

- **main.tf**: Configures the GAE service, including environment variables, scaling, and health checks.
- **variables.tf**: Defines the variables used in the Terraform configuration.
- **outputs.tf**: Specifies the output values for important resources.
- **provider.tf**: Configures the Google Cloud provider.
- **iam.tf**: Sets up IAM roles and permissions for deploying to GAE.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Terraform**: Ensure you have Terraform installed on your machine.

2. **Configure Variables**: Update `terraform/variables.tf` with your project-specific values.

3. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration.

4. **Apply Configuration**: Run `terraform apply` to provision the resources.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Workflow Overview

- **gae-deploy.yml**: Defines the CI/CD pipeline for deploying the application to GAE.

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Build**: Checks out the code and installs dependencies.
2. **Test**: Runs the test suite to ensure code quality.
3. **Deploy**: Deploys the application to GAE using the Google Cloud SDK.
4. **Verification**: Performs a health check on the deployed application.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**: Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Your Google Cloud project ID.
   - `GCP_SA_KEY`: The service account key JSON for authentication.

2. **Trigger Deployment**: Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the deployment pipeline.

## Best Practices

- **Security**: Ensure your service account has the least privilege necessary.
- **Scalability**: Configure automatic scaling based on your application's needs.
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and logging for your application to track performance and errors.

By following this guide, you can efficiently set up and deploy your application to Google App Engine using Terraform and GitHub Actions.
